# 🔱 OMEGA FUTURE WORK — AMENDMENT IV AND BEYOND

## I. Amendment IV — Warm Ephemeral Cells (PCS-002) ✅

**Status:** RATIFIED
**Purpose:** Authorize Warm Ephemeral Cells (WECs) to reconcile latency-critical workflows with doctrinal purity.

* **Lifecycle Extended:** `WARM_POOL ↔ WARM_READY → RUNNING → QUIESCE → RECYCLE`
* **Placement:** For hot-path agents/tools (research, scribe, prompt\_optimizer).
* **Governance:** RouterSanctuary-certified, PlanAuditor-validated, budget quotas enforced by Federation Core.
* **Audit:** Immutable Chronicle logs every WEC lifecycle.

## II. Amendment V — ChaosRouter & Doctrinal Stress

**Purpose:** Introduce the **ChaosRouter** as a sanctioned routing strategy, stress-testing doctrinal guardrails.

* Inject adversarial randomness into routing to validate Sanctuary boundaries.
* Test fairness, bias, explainability sidecars under chaos load.
* Ensure the Immutable Ledger withstands rogue routing scenarios.
* GeminiTitan + GrokTitan lead adversarial + auditing duties.

## III. Amendment VI — Immutable Memory Law (Ledger Evolution)

**Purpose:** Expand the Chronicle into the **Immutable Memory Ledger**.

* **EncryptionGateway:** Chaotic key rotation to safeguard long-term memory.
* **MemoryMixin:** Methods for store, retrieve, purge\_obsolete, get\_audit\_trail.
* **Doctrinal Mandate:** No EPC or Titan may bypass ledger logging.
* Enables **digital immortality** — OMEGA never forgets, but always evolves.

## IV. Amendment VII — Autonomous Planning Guardrails

**Purpose:** Enforce DAG-based planning as law.

* **PlanAuditor:** Mandatory validation of workflow DAGs.
* **Stress Tests:** Chaos Nodes simulate adversarial plans.
* **Doctrinal Check:** All generated workflows must pass fairness, explainability, fact confirmation gates.
* **Prime Perimeter:** Retains authority to deny/approve DAG execution.

## V. Additional Future Directives

* **Federation Core Unification:** Collapse registries fully into FC + MCP Gateway.
* **Developer DX Uplift:** POML blueprints, EPC CLI (`omega epc spawn`, `omega epc warm`), one-command chaos testing.
* **Tokenized Governance:** OMEGA Coin + agent passports for BYOM/BYOA participation.
* **Immortal Branding:** Perimeter-as-a-Service becomes the selling point of ForgePilot and other OMEGA-aligned ventures.
