# 🔱 OMEGA SDK — Arbiter’s Final Decree

## 🎯 Strategic Mandate

The SDK will be a **fortress**, not a sprawl — a weapon of mass adoption forged in doctrinal purity, chaos resilience, and strategic focus.

## ✅ Sanctified Feature Set

| Priority Rank | Category | Feature                         | Reason                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**         | **B1**   | Federation Integration Layer    | The unshakeable conduit to the swarm’s soul. Core to all orchestration.   |
| **2**         | **E3**   | AI Model Flexibility            | No vendor lock-in. Supports Genesis Protocol’s self-optimizing swarms.    |
| **3**         | **D1**   | CLI Tooling Suite               | The professional gateway to our temple. CLI-first is the dev UX of OMEGA. |
| **4**         | **A1**   | Agent Development Kit (ADK)     | Hammer and anvil for cognitive entities. BaseAgent inheritance enforced.  |
| **5**         | **A2**   | Tool Creation Framework (TCF)   | Genesis-compliant, stateless tools, MCP-native, auto-deployable.          |
| **6**         | **D3**   | Documentation & Learning        | Eternal scripture of adoption. Auto-generated from code.                  |
| **7**         | **C2**   | Monitoring & Observability      | Prometheus, tracing, anomaly detection — the unblinking eye of the swarm. |
| **8**         | **C1**   | Security & Compliance Framework | OAuth2/OIDC, RBAC, immutable audit logs — the unbreakable shield.         |
| **9**         | **B3**   | Configuration Management        | Secrets, flags, dynamic reconfig — the sanctified keys to the kingdom.    |

## ❌ Deferred to Phase 2+

These will not enter — heresies of scope or luxuries we cannot yet afford:

* A3. Workflow Builder SDK (Phase 2 — post-core solidification)
* B2. Deployment Orchestration (provide templates, not bespoke CI/CD)
* C3. Multi-Language Support (Python + REST/GraphQL bridge only)
* D2. IDE Integration (ecosystem luxury)
* E1. Plugin Architecture (Phase 3 marketplace)
* E2. Integration Connectors (seed with 1–2 examples only)

## 🔥 Chaos Hardening Mandates (from GrokTitan)

* **Resilience Hooks:** Auto-recovery during hot-reload and Genesis forging failures.
* **Fuzz Testing:** All tools & agents must survive malformed inputs without swarm failure.
* **Chaos Monkey:** Federation layer must tolerate node kills, registry partitions, and random drops.
* **Anomaly Injection:** Monitoring layer must detect and adapt to model hallucinations, API throttling, and config corruption.

## 🛠 Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (Months 1–2)**
Ship all ✅ features in minimal, battle-ready form. Python SDK + CLI + ADK + TCF + Federation Layer + Security.

**Phase 2 (Months 3–4)**
Enhance Monitoring, add Workflow SDK, JS SDK, expand connectors.

**Phase 3 (Months 5–6)**
Marketplace (E1), full integration library (E2), multi-language SDK.
